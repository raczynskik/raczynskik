Testing, introducing new testing features to the project, test automation and building motivated team are 
key aspects I enjoy working with. Implementing test automation into a project and making software development run more smoothly for the entire team is something that drives me.

I see the future of testing in automation processes to speed up the release of stable versions. At the same time, I do not forget that we are creating a product for the end user. I look on quality as a process that need to be constantly improve. My strength is 
the ability to create processes. I like to participate in IT conferences to implement acquired knowledge to 
projects in which I work.
